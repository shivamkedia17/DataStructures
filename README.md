Codefile descriptions

1. *forloop* - See where forloop goes wrong due to decimal imprecision
2. *matrixmult* - Multiplies two matrices in C
3. *decimal_addition* - Checks if adding 0.1 3 times is 0.3 (for a stupid computer, ofc)
4. *Bubble Sort* - generates array of a given size and bubble sorts


That's all for now, will update as code is written.
